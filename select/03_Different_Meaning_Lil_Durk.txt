When you wake up off them pills, that feeling terrible
The worst thing to be known is when they scared of you
And they gon' laugh right in your face when they ahead of you
And to be technical, that shit we do is federal
Hold the tears back from this life is so unbearable
You a copycat, that's not lean, that's Theraflu
I'ma jump from the top of my money with a parachute
And who you look up to? A ho I wouldn't dare salute
I keep taking care of my killers they wouldn't care to shoot
I got your address from a bitch, just for a pair of shoes
You gotta text, like "He got hit", that shit be scary news
They told me get up out the streets, you can go back to school
My life hurt so bad, thinking 'bout if you was here what kind of life you would have
Nowadays the way we live, we live life on the edge
Nowadays the way we live, you would die if you scared, uh
This life is for the ghetto
This life, this life, this life
This life is for the ghetto
This life, this life, this life
Nobody put fear in us
I put real life inside this music, they not hearing us
I know it's real, I had some real killers tearing up
I did all I can for 'em, they not sincere enough
They stopped leading me way back then, they can't cheer at us
It get treacherous, that's why they don't mention us
Why you holdin' onto a snitch, just give that victim up
They can't take care of us alone, that's why they cliquin' up
They told me to go pop and get the trenches up
I say fuck that shit, four killers inside a Bentley truck
Would have been five but one of 'em died, so I was giving up
Wish I talked to him on the last call, told him live it up
Where the love? Where the love?
You know it's tiring tryna clean blood from a rug
You know it's tiring watching my back and ducking slugs
I know two robbers said they tired of sticking up
This life is for the ghetto
This life, this life, this life
This life is for the ghetto
This life, this life, this life
This life is for the ghetto
This life, this life, this life
This life is for the ghetto
This life, this life, this life
