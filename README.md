# Rol3ert – meaning

> **歌詞登録ステータス：プレーン歌詞のみ**

```
Nobody knows
I only know
There’s no way of
knowing how this works
If I try to build it,
you’re gonna
break the whole thing
You’ll never know
Don’t be so sure
They try to make
the right things wrong
I can’t believe it works
Take me back to the time
When we felt alike
No need to be
two different things
We’re the same,
but it ends, and it turns out
We made it by ourselves
Take me back to the time
When we felt alike
No need to be
two different things
We’re the same,
but it ends, and it turns out
We made it by ourselves
Never been enough
Save me in this blast
We all want a meaning
But why?
Never been enough
Save me in this blast
Everything is changing
But why?
選べない　居場所や
形が　nightmareに
変わらないのに
意味もない　形が　時には血を流す
I can’t believe it works
Take me back to the time
When we felt alike
No need to be
two different things
We’re the same,
but it ends, and it turns out
We made it by ourselves
Take me back to the time
When we felt alike
No need to be
two different things
We’re the same,
but it ends, and it turns out
We made it by ourselves
Never been enough
Save me in this blast
We all want a meaning
But why?
Never been enough
Save me in this blast
Everything is changing
But why?
